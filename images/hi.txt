ilename: gives name of the file that the file object has opened.

How to Create a Text File in Python
With Python Write to File, you can create a .text files (guru99.txt) by using the code, we have demonstrated here:

Step 1)

	f= open("guru99.txt","w+")
We declared the variable f to open a file named guru99.txt. Open takes 2 arguments, the file that we want to open and a string that represents the kinds of permission or operation we want to do on the file
Here, we used "w" letter in our argument, which indicates Python write to file and it will create a file if it does not exist in library
Plus sign indicates both read and write for Python create file operation.
Step 2)

for i in range(10):
     f.write("This is line %d\r\n" % (i+1))
We have a for loop that runs over a range of 10 numbers.
Using the write function to enter data into the file.
The output we want to iterate in the file is "this is line number", which we declare with Python write to text file function and then percent d (displays integer)
So basically we are putting in the line number that we are writing, then putting it in a carriage return and a new line character
Step 3)

	f.close() 
This will close the instance of the file guru99.txt stored
Here is the result after code execution for Python create file
